## Dependencies Between Stages
- Core infrastructure (Stage 1) must be completed before any other stages
- User features (Stage 2) should be completed before social features
- Notification system (Stage 4) requires user settings from Stage 2
- Social features (Stage 5) depend on proper privacy controls
- AI integration (Stage 6) requires sufficient data collection
- Advanced features should only be implemented after core functionality is stable

## Notes
- Each stage should be treated as a mini-project with its own planning, implementation, testing, and deployment cycle
- Stages can be modified or reordered based on priority changes or user feedback
- Each feature should be implemented with PWA compatibility in mind
- Security and privacy considerations should be addressed at every stage
- Regular testing and monitoring should be maintained throughout development
